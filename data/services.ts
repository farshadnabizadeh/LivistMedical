        "Consultation: Initiating the face lift journey involves a detailed consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon at Livist Medical. During this session, personal goals, expectations, and concerns are discussed, alongside a thorough assessment of facial structure, skin condition, and overall health.",
        "Preoperative Preparation: Candidates deemed suitable for a face lift receive comprehensive preoperative instructions, covering medications, lifestyle adjustments, and arrangements for post-surgery transportation.",
        "Anesthesia: Livist Medical provides face lift surgery under either general anesthesia or intravenous sedation with local anesthesia, tailored to individual preferences and medical considerations.",
        "Incisions: The surgeon carefully places incisions along the hairline and around the ears, ensuring minimal visibility. The incision pattern depends on the selected face lift type—traditional, mini, or neck lift.",
        "Tissue Repositioning: Lifting and repositioning of underlying tissues, including muscles and fat, are meticulously performed to create a more youthful facial appearance. Excess fat removal and skin tightening contribute to the transformative process.",
        "Skin Redraping: Excess skin is redraped over repositioned tissues, and any surplus skin is trimmed away. Closure is achieved through sutures, skin adhesives, or staples, ensuring a seamless finish.",
        "Recovery: Post-surgery monitoring in a designated recovery area is standard until the effects of anesthesia wear off. Mild swelling, bruising, and discomfort may occur, managed with prescribed pain medication. Adherence to postoperative care instructions is crucial for optimal healing.",
        "Healing and Results: Individual recovery periods may vary, but most individuals can resume regular activities within weeks. Avoidance of strenuous exercise and sun exposure during initial healing is recommended. Full results become apparent gradually over several months."
